# RoShamBo Bots

Bots from the International RoShamBo Programming Competition, available as an
optional dependency. See `open_spiel/scripts/global_variables.sh` to configure
conditional dependencies and enable this.

The competition was held in 1999 and 2000 by Darse Billings at the University of
Alberta. The player pool was seeded with dummy bots, requiring competitive
entrants to exploit sub-optimal play while avoiding getting exploited by other
sophisticated bots. For more information, and all code used in the first
competition, see https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html.

No additional code from the second competition was officially released, but
Andrzej Nagorko, author of the winning entrant Greenberg, independently released
the botâ€™s source code http://www.mathpuzzle.com/older.htm. Greenberg is also
included as an OpenSpiel bot.
