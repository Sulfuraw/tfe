# Installation

## Python-only installation via pip

If you plan to only use the Python API, then the easiest way to install
OpenSpiel is to use pip. As only source distribution is currently supported,
CMake, Clang and Python 3 development files are required to build the Python
extension. Note that we recommend Clang but g++ >= 9.2 should also work.

E.g. on Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
# Check to see if you have the necessary tools for building OpenSpiel:
cmake --version        # Must be >= 3.12
clang++ --version      # Must be >= 7.0.0
python3-config --help

# If not, run this line to install them.
# On older Linux distros, the package might be called clang-9 or clang-10
sudo apt-get install cmake clang python3-dev

# On older Linux distros, the versions may be too old.
# E.g. on Ubuntu 18.04, there are a few extra steps:
# sudo apt-get install clang-10
# pip3 install cmake  # You might need to relogin to get the new CMake version
# export CXX=clang++-10

# Recommended: Install pip dependencies and run under virtualenv.
sudo apt-get install virtualenv python3-virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Finally, install OpenSpiel and its dependencies:
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools pip
pip3 install open_spiel

# To exit the virtual env
deactivate

## **IMPORTANT NOTE**. If the build fails, please first make sure you have the
## required versions of the tools above and that you followed the recommended
## option. Then, open an issue: https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues
```

Note that the build could take several minutes.

On MacOS, you can install the dependencies via `brew install cmake python3`. For
clang, you need to install or upgrade XCode and install the command-line
developer tools.

## Installation from Source

The instructions here are for Linux and MacOS. For installation on Windows, see
[these separate installation instructions](windows.md). On Linux, we recommend
Ubuntu 20.04 (or 19.10), Debian 10, or later versions. There are
[known issues](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues/407) with default
compilers on Ubuntu on 18.04, and `clang-10` must be installed separately. On
MacOS, we recommend XCode 11 or newer.

For the Python API: our tests run using Python 3.8 and 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04 and
MacOS 10.15. We also test using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Python 3.6. So, we
recommend one of these setups. If you encounter any problems on other setups,
please let us know by opening an issue.

Currently there are two installation methods:

1.  building from the source code and editing `PYTHONPATH`.
2.  using `pip install` to build and testing using
    [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/). A pip package to install directly
    does not exist yet.
3.  installing via [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

## Summary

In a nutshell:

```bash
./install.sh  # Needed to run once and when major changes are released.
./open_spiel/scripts/build_and_run_tests.sh # Run this every-time you need to rebuild.
```

1.  Install system packages (e.g. cmake) and download some dependencies. Only
    needs to be run once or if you enable some new conditional dependencies (see
    specific section below).

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

2.  Install your Python dependencies, e.g. in Python 3 using
    [`virtualenv`](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/):

    ```bash
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Use `deactivate` to quit the virtual environment.

    `pip` should be installed once and upgraded:

    ```
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    # Install pip deps as your user. Do not use the system's pip.
    python3 get-pip.py
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install --upgrade setuptools testresources
    ```

3.  This sections differs depending on the installation procedure:

    **Building and testing from source**

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ./open_spiel/scripts/build_and_run_tests.sh
    ```

    **Building and testing using PIP**

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install .
    pip install nox
    nox -s tests
    ```

    Optionally, use `pip install -e` to install in
    [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs),
    which will allow you to skip this `pip install` step if you edit any Python
    source files. If you edit any C++ files, you will have to rerun the install
    command.

4.  Only when building from source:

    ```bash
    # For the python modules in open_spiel.
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>
    # For the Python bindings of Pyspiel
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>/build/python
    ```

    to `./venv/bin/activate` or your `~/.bashrc` to be able to import OpenSpiel
    from anywhere.

To make sure OpenSpiel works on the default configurations, we do use the
`python3` command and not `python` (which still defaults to Python 2 on modern
Linux versions).

## Installing via Docker

Please note that we don't regularly test the Docker installation. As such, it
may not work at any given time. We are investigating enabling tests and proper
longer-term support, but it may take some time. Until then, if you encounter a
problem, please [open an issue](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues).

Option 1 (Basic, 3.13GB):

```bash
docker build --target base -t openspiel -f Dockerfile.base .
```

Option 2 (Slim, 2.26GB):

```bash
docker build --target python-slim -t openspiel -f Dockerfile.base .
```

If you are only interested in developing in Python, use the second image. You
can navigate through the runtime of the container (after the build step) with:

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash openspiel
```

Finally you can run examples using:

```bash
docker run openspiel python3 python/examples/matrix_game_example.py
docker run openspiel python3 python/examples/example.py
```


Option 3 (Jupyter Notebook):

Installs OpenSpiel with an additional Jupyter Notebook environment.

```bash
docker build -t openspiel-notebook -f Dockerfile.jupyter --rm .
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 openspiel-notebook
```

_More info_: https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Running the first examples

In the `build` directory, running `examples/example` will prints out a list of
registered games and the usage. Now, letâ€™s play game of Tic-Tac-Toe with uniform
random players:

```bash
examples/example --game=tic_tac_toe
```

Once the proper Python paths are set, from the main directory (one above
`build`), try these out:

```bash
# Similar to the C++ example:
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/example.py --game=breakthrough

# Play a game against a random or MCTS bot:
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/mcts.py --game=tic_tac_toe --player1=human --player2=random
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/mcts.py --game=tic_tac_toe --player1=human --player2=mcts
```

## Detailed steps

### Configuration conditional dependencies

See [open_spiel/scripts/global_variables.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/scripts/global_variables.sh) to configure the
conditional dependencies. See also the [Developer Guide](developer_guide.md).

### Installing system-wide dependencies

See [open_spiel/scripts/install.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/scripts/install.sh) for the required packages and cloned
repositories.

### Installing Python dependencies

Using a `virtualenv` to install python dependencies is highly recommended. For
more information see:
[https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

Install dependencies (Python 3):

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, although not recommended, you can install the Python dependencies
system-wide with:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Building and running tests

Make sure that the virtual environment is still activated.

By default, Clang C++ compiler is used (and potentially installed by
[open_spiel/scripts/install.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/scripts/install.sh)).

Build and run tests (Python 3):

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
CXX=clang++ cmake -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3) -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CXX} ../open_spiel
make -j$(nproc)
ctest -j$(nproc)
```

The CMake variable `Python3_EXECUTABLE` is used to specify the Python
interpreter. If the variable is not set, CMake's FindPython3 module will prefer
the latest version installed. Note, Python >= 3.6.0 is required.

One can run an example of a game running (in the `build/` folder):

```bash
./examples/example --game=tic_tac_toe
```

### Setting Your PYTHONPATH environment variable

To be able to import the Python code (both the C++ binding `pyspiel` and the
rest) from any location, you will need to add to your PYTHONPATH the root
directory and the `open_spiel` directory.

When using a virtualenv, the following should be added to
`<virtualenv>/bin/activate`. For a system-wide install, ddd it in your `.bashrc`
or `.profile`.

```bash
# For the python modules in open_spiel.
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>
# For the Python bindings of Pyspiel
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>/build/python
```
